<h2>Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10</h2>
<p>Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.</p>
<h3>Output:</h2>
<pre id="output">Output goes here (replace via script)</pre>
<h3>Code:</h2>
<pre id="code">var output=""; //the HTML output to put in "output"

var max_number=10; //the maximum number to print even numbers up to
for(var i=0;i<=max_number;i+=2)
{
	output=output+i+" ";
}

document.getElementById("output").innerHTML=output; //send output to the output tab</pre>
<script>
var output=""; //the HTML output to put in "output"

var max_number=10; //the maximum number to print even numbers up to
for(var i=0;i<=max_number;i+=2)
{
	output=output+i+" ";
}

document.getElementById("output").innerHTML=output; //send output to the output tab
